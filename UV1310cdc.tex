\begin{abstract}
Next generation short reach communication systems require high-performance and low cost optical filters for wavelength division multiplexing. We measured performance of add-drop filters fabricated using a CMOS compatible process. C-band and O-band.

\section{Introduction}
\subsection{Relevance and place in the greater scheme}
\todo{Point out that optical filters are needed for WDM. }

\subsection{State of the Art}
\todo{Speak about lattice filters, echelle/arrayed waveguides, ring on SOI. None of these are flat top, limited FSR, low bandwidth. Bragg gratings only reflect. Apodized contra-DC only work on E-beam.}\cite{xu2006cascaded}

\subsection{Challenges}
\todo{Small corrugation size and period, expecially at 1310. Accuracy for apodization. Large enough coupling}



\section{Device}
\subsection{Design} 
\todo{Slab and thin waveguides for bigger overlap. Traditional apodized side-wall grating.}
\begin{figure}[htbp]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=.99\columnwidth]{CrossAndTop}
	\caption{Schematic cross-section and colored microscope top view of the grating (a) The contra-directional coupler is made of two silicon waveguides of different widths $w_1$ and $w_2$ with an average gap $g$ in-between them. The gap varies along the propagation axis. (b) SEM image shows the shape of the corrugations after fabrication with ultraviolet lithography. }
	\label{fig:Device}
\end{figure}

The contra-directional coupler consists of two waveguides in close proximity, with a periodic change to the gap in-between them. This causes a wavelength selective contra-directional coupling at  $\lambda_\text{c} = \Lambda (n_\text{1}+n_\text{2})$, where $\Lambda$ is the grating pitch, and $n_\text{1}$ and $n_\text{2}$ are the effective refractive indices of the first-order and second-order eigenmodes in the coupler. 
The waveguides are highly asymmetric to suppress the co-directional coupling that occurs with two identical waveguides.

\subsection{Fabrication process}
\todo{Fabrication using a CMOS compatible UV lithography with a phase-shifted mask.}

\subsection{Fabrication result}
\todo{Clear corrugations and the possibility to have a small gap under 140 nm.}
\begin{figure}[htbp]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=.60\columnwidth]{1310_P36_g190maybe}
	\caption{SEM picture of a strong grating. The measurements show that the widths of the waveguides are not the same in the close and far region, resulting in a strong change of index along the propagation direction and a distortion of the apodization profile. }

\section{Conclusion}
\todo{The demonstrated device open possibilities for wide bandwidth and temperature tolerant filters with a flat top response. Next prototypes promise to offer even larger bandwidth and a more square shape after biasing for lithography.}
