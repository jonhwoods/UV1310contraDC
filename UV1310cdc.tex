\section{Introduction}
\subsection{Relevance and place in the greater scheme}
\todo{Point out that optical filters are needed for WDM. }

\subsection{State of the Art}
\todo{Speak about lattice filters, echelle/arrayed waveguides, ring on SOI. None of these are flat top, limited FSR, low bandwidth. Bragg gratings only reflect. Apodized contra-DC only work on E-beam.}

Integrated WDM is currently achieved using lattice filters\cite{horst2013cascaded} or arrayed waveguides \cite{okamoto2013fabrication}, though these methods use a large footprint and have a limited free-spectral range. Others possible approaches include Bragg gratings\cite{simard2012apodized} and micro-ring filter\cite{xu2006cascaded}.

\subsection{Challenges}
\todo{Small corrugation size and period, expecially at 1310. Accuracy for apodization. Large enough coupling}
Contra-directional couplers can offer large bandwidth, compact footprint and high sidelobes suppression, but the small feature size needed for gratings limits the performance when fabricated with conventional deep-ultraviolet lithography\cite{shi2013ultra}\cite{shi2013coupler}. This issue is compounded when designing a device for the O-band (around 1310 nm), which is an useful band for lower dispersion in conventional fibers and additional bandwidth, as the small wavelength size requires a proportionally smaller grating step.



\section{Device}
\subsection{Design} 
\todo{Slab and thin waveguides for bigger overlap. Traditional apodized side-wall grating.}
\begin{figure}[htbp]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=.99\columnwidth]{CrossAndTop}
	\caption{ (a)Schematic cross-section: The contra-directional coupler is made of two silicon waveguides of different widths $w_1$ and $w_2$ with an average gap $g$ in-between them. The gap varies along the propagation axis. (b) Colored microscope top view of the grating shows the shape of the corrugations after fabrication with ultraviolet lithography. }
	\label{fig:Device}
\end{figure}
Figure \ref{fig:Device} shows the proposed structure.

The contra-directional coupler consists of two waveguides in close proximity, with a periodic change to the gap in-between them. This causes a wavelength selective contra-directional coupling at  $\lambda_\text{c} = \Lambda (n_\text{1}+n_\text{2})$, where $\Lambda$ is the grating pitch, and $n_\text{1}$ and $n_\text{2}$ are the effective refractive indices of the first-order and second-order eigenmodes in the coupler. 
The waveguides are highly asymmetric to suppress the co-directional coupling that would occur with two identical waveguides.

\subsection{Fabrication process}
\todo{Fabrication using a CMOS compatible UV lithography with a phase-shifted mask.}

\subsection{Fabrication result}
\todo{Clear corrugations and the possibility to have a small gap under 140 nm.}
\begin{figure}[htbp]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=.60\columnwidth]{1310_P36_g190maybe}
	\caption{SEM picture of a strong grating. The measurements show that the widths of the waveguides are not the same in the close and far region, resulting in a strong change of index along the propagation direction and a distortion of the apodization profile. }
	\label{fig:litho}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Filter optical performance}
\todo{[Plot of the optical response ]}

\subsection{WDM performance}
We see in figure \ref{fig:WDM} the response of the filter using a single filtering stage and also for two filtering stages.
\begin{figure}[htbp]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=.99\columnwidth]{WDM}
	\caption{a) Single stage WDM. b) Double staged WDM }
	\label{fig:WDM}
\end{figure}




\section{Conclusion}
\todo{The demonstrated device open possibilities for wide bandwidth and temperature tolerant filters with a flat top response. Next prototypes promise to offer even larger bandwidth and a more square shape after biasing for lithography.}
